Hello,

my expert system is about your favorite drink!
You get asked questions and it will tell you what drink was on your mind.
You can add your own drink too!
When your drink has been found it tells you a funfact :) (this doesnt apply on later added drinks)
just load drinks.pl and start main.

IMPORTANT HINT:

same drink-> first one gets choosen

there are some bugs that i couldnt get rid of... Somehow it ignores some answers 
and promts you with a drink that should not be possible. This bug occured on the last day
and i really dont know whats the cause. It worked fine all the time.
But i added a "No" button, so the program continuesto ask you questions. 
In the end it reaches the right drink. Its a workaround and im sorry 
for this because it worked all the time but some changes i did a few days ago broke it.

When adding a Drink, make sure its all written in lower case! 

My "Undo." function doesnt work too. I dont see any mistake in retracting things out of the 
database but it always says that there are arguments missing even if theres always blanks as 
arguments. Its weird because my undo_name works and is nearly the same function :(
Because of this you  will have to completely shutdown Prolog and start over again after one round.

Im sure that the fixes for those bugs take little changes but i have a rought time the last weeks
with a two holiday courses and a fulltime job.

However i think my programm will be sufficient to pass! It took me much time to be honest.
(the XPCE part wasnt the big issue)

Have fun trying it out and maybe you will see my mistakes at first sight :)
